Create a visualizer for Algorithms and Data Structures

Primarily for review and continued experience working with algorithms

1. Choose a list of starting algorithms
2. How am I going to implement them
3. How am I going to visualize them

Data structures I want to include:
    - linked list
    - Doubly linked list
    - Heap
    - Binary tree
    - Red Black tree
